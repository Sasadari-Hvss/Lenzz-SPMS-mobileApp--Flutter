# Software Project Management System

Software project management systems have become a vital part of the IT industry due to their ability to handle and manage complex software development projects effectively. The software project management system aims to provide a solution to the issues of cost, facilities, and communication among project members that earlier management systems had limitations with.

## Problem

The complexity of the software development process involves planning, designing, analyzing, development, and maintenance. Manual project management is inefficient and lacks clarity, leading to problems in communication, understanding of tasks, and wasted time. The software project management system addresses these issues and ensures effective task allocation, monitoring, and timely completion.

## Objectives

The objectives of the software project management system are to distribute tasks among team members easily, monitor task completion within the given time frame, point out mistakes easily, manage multiple projects without switching between tasks, and communicate within the project effectively.

## Solution

The proposed solution is an effective and efficient framework for the software project management system that can be customized according to the requirements of the company. The system includes features such as task cards, project progress, Kanban board, and a chat room for communication. The proposed software project management system aims to provide a solution to the limitations of earlier systems, enabling efficient project management for the IT industry.

## Features

* Task Cards: A system that allows the allocation of tasks to specific team members, with the ability to track task completion and progress.
* Project Progress: A feature that allows project managers to view and monitor project progress, ensuring timely completion of tasks.
* Kanban Board: A tool that enables the team to visualize the workflow, manage tasks, and track progress.
